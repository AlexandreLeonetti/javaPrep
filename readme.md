-Question 1 :

```java 
int i1 =5;
int i2 =2;
int i3 = i1/i2;
```

what is the value i3 ?
answer : 2;

-Question 2:
Which method is called when a thread is executed ?
answer : the run() method;

-Question 3:
A.isFoo(String param) should return true if param is equal  to the string  "foo",
false  otherwise.

implement a.isFoo(String param).
answer :
public class A {
   static boolean  isFoo(String  param){
    return param == "foo";
   } 
}

-Question 4:
Which option is a valid constant declaration in Java?
answer :

    // Constant declaration using 'final' keyword
    public static final int MAX_VALUE = 100;

-Question 5:
In Java, private variables can only be accessed within the same class in which they are declared. 
This means that subclasses cannot directly access private variables of their superclass.

-Question 6:
Can an abstract class contain a concrete method ?
yes , Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, 
and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. 
However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, 
and define public, protected, and private concrete methods.

-Question 7:
a java class can have more than one parent class (multiple inheritance)? 
NO
Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces but limits inheritance to a single parent class,
effectively avoiding the diamond problem and the associated complexities in method resolution.

-Question 8:
A method declared as final means ?
You can declare some or all of a class's methods final.
You use the final keyword in a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
The Object class does this—a number of its methods are final .

-Question 9:
Complete the answer to make the following peace of code  valid:
A a = new A();
A b = new B();

answer :
```java
class A {}

class B extends A {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        A b = new B();
        
        System.out.println("Instance of A: " + a.getClass().getName());
        System.out.println("Instance of B: " + b.getClass().getName());
    }
}
```
In this code:

class A is a simple class.
class B extends class A, making B a subclass of A.
In the main method, A a = new A(); creates an instance of A, and A b = new B(); 
creates an instance of B but assigns it to a variable of type A. 
This is possible because B is a subclass of A.

-Question 10:
Which exceptions belongs to the J2SE API?
The Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) API includes a variety of exceptions that are part of the Java programming language. These exceptions are categorized into two main types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions).

Checked Exceptions
Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be either caught or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword. Some common checked exceptions in the J2SE API are:

IOException

FileNotFoundException
EOFException
SQLException

ClassNotFoundException

CloneNotSupportedException

InterruptedException

InstantiationException

IllegalAccessException

NoSuchMethodException

NoSuchFieldException
======================================
Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)
Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in a method's throws clause. These are subclasses of RuntimeException. Some common runtime exceptions in the J2SE API are:

NullPointerException

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

ArithmeticException

ClassCastException

IllegalArgumentException

NumberFormatException
IllegalStateException

IndexOutOfBoundsException

StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
UnsupportedOperationException

Error Classes
Additionally, the J2SE API defines several Error classes, which are used to indicate serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Some common error classes include:

OutOfMemoryError

StackOverflowError

VirtualMachineError

InternalError
UnknownError


-Question 11:
some code :
HashMap m = new HashMap();
Object o1 = new Object();
Object o2 = o1;
m.put(o1, 1);
m.put(o2, 2);
m.get(o1);

answer :
In this piece of Java code, the behavior of the HashMap is being demonstrated with respect to object references. 
Here is a detailed explanation of what is happening:

Creating the HashMap:

java
Copy code
HashMap m = new HashMap();
A new HashMap object is created.
This HashMap will store key-value pairs where the keys and values can be objects.

Creating Objects:

java
Copy code
Object o1 = new Object();
Object o2 = o1;
o1 is assigned a new Object instance.
o2 is assigned the same reference as o1. 
Thus, o2 is not a new object but rather a reference to the same object as o1.
Putting Key-Value Pairs into the HashMap:

java
Copy code
m.put(o1, 1);
m.put(o2, 2);
m.put(o1, 1); inserts a key-value pair where the key is o1 and the value is 1.
m.put(o2, 2); inserts a key-value pair where the key is o2 and the value is 2.
Since o1 and o2 refer to the same object, the second put operation will replace the value associated with the key o1 in the HashMap.

Retrieving the Value:

java
Copy code
System.out.println(m.get(o1));
m.get(o1) retrieves the value associated with the key o1 from the HashMap.
Since the second put operation replaced the value associated with o1 (which is the same object as o2) to 2, the retrieved value will be 2.


-Question 12:
a protected attribute is visible from a class that belongs to the same package.
true
Yes, it is true that a protected attribute is visible from a class that belongs to the same package.
 In Java, the protected access modifier has package-level visibility in addition to subclass visibility. This means that:

Within the same package: Any class in the same package as the class containing the protected member can access the protected member.
In subclasses: Any subclass, even if it is in a different package, can access the protected member.

-Question 13:
try to improve the code displayed in the answer editor

-Question 16;

public class A {}

who is the parent of class A ?

answer :
In Java, every class implicitly extends the Object class if it does not explicitly extend another class. The Object class is the root of the class hierarchy. Every class has Object as a superclass, either directly or indirectly.

The parent of class A is java.lang.Object.

-question 17;

String s;
what is the value of s ?

In Java, the default value of an uninitialized string is null. Therefore, the correct answer is a. Null. When a string variable is declared but not initialized, it automatically takes the value of null.

You have to organize a chess tournamept in which players will compete head-to-head.
Here is how we proceed to form the duels: select a first player randomly, then, select his opponent at random among the remaining participants. The pair of competitors obtained forms one of the duels of the tournament. We proceed in the same manner to form all the other pairs.
In this exercise, we would like to know how many pairs it is possible to form knowing that the order of opponents in a pair does not matter.
For example, with 4 players named A, B, C and D, it is possible to get 6 different pairs : AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.
Implement count to return the number of possible pairs. Parameter n corresponds to the number of players.
Try to optimize your solution so that, ideally, the duration of treatment is the same for any
Input: 2 <= n <= 10000)

-Question 25;
which are primitive types in java ?


-Question 26;
Private static class A {}
In which case is this class correct ?

Choose one or few answers :
1 Never
2 An anonymous class
3 An inner class
4 Always

Answer :

The statement private static class A {} defines a nested static class with a private access modifier. To determine when this class declaration is correct, we need to understand the context in which it can be used.

A private static nested class can only be declared within another class, and its accessibility is restricted to the enclosing class. Here are the possible scenarios:

Never: This is not correct because there are cases where a private static class is valid.
An anonymous class: This is not applicable since an anonymous class is a class without a name, and the provided declaration is not an anonymous class.
An inner class: This is partially correct. A private static class is a form of a nested class, but it is specifically a nested static class, not an inner class (which is non-static).
Always: This is not correct because a private static class declaration must be within another class.
The correct answer is:

3. An inner class

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private static class A {
        // Class implementation
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A aInstance = new A(); // This is valid within the enclosing class

-Question 28;
```java
ArrayList list1 = new ArrayList(2);

list1.add(1);
list1.add(1);
list1.add(1);
```

what is the value returned by list1.size()?

answer :

Creating the ArrayList:

java
Copy code
ArrayList list1 = new ArrayList(2);
This line creates a new ArrayList with an initial capacity of 2. The capacity is the number of elements the list can hold before it needs to resize. However, the size of the list is initially 0.

Adding elements to the list:

java
Copy code
list1.add(1);
list1.add(1);
list1.add(1);
These lines add three elements to the ArrayList. Each call to add() increases the size of the list by 1. The capacity of the list will automatically increase as needed to accommodate new elements.

What happens during the additions:
When the first element is added, the size of the list becomes 1.
When the second element is added, the size of the list becomes 2.
When the third element is added, the list exceeds its initial capacity of 2. The ArrayList automatically resizes to accommodate the new element, and the size becomes 3.

returns 3;

-Question 30;

StreamPrinter.print (Reader reader) is not robust.
Improve StreamPrinter.print (Reader reader)

import java.io. IOException; 
Import java. io.Reader;

/* This class defines a stream printer.*/
class StreamPrinter {
/**
Reads from the given reader and print to stdout.*/
void print (Reader reader) throws IOException {
int code = reader. read();
while (code != - 1) {
System. out.print ((char) code);
code = reader.read();
}
reader. close();
}
}


answer :
To improve the StreamPrinter.print method, we should handle exceptions more robustly and ensure that resources are properly closed, even in case of an exception. Using a try-with-resources statement is a good approach to automatically handle closing resources. Additionally, we'll add proper exception handling to provide a more robust implementation.

Here's the improved version of the StreamPrinter.print method:

```java

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Reader;

/* This class defines a stream printer. */
class StreamPrinter {
    /**
     * Reads from the given reader and prints to stdout.
     */
    void print(Reader reader) {
        try (Reader r = reader) {
            int code;
            while ((code = r.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) code);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred while reading from the reader: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage of StreamPrinter
        StringReader stringReader = new StringReader("Hello, World!");
        StreamPrinter streamPrinter = new StreamPrinter();
        streamPrinter.print(stringReader);
    }
}

```

Explanation:
try-with-resources: This statement ensures that the Reader is closed automatically at the end of the block, whether an exception occurs or not. This eliminates the need to explicitly close the Reader and ensures that resources are always properly released.

Exception Handling: The catch block catches IOException and prints an error message along with the stack trace. This helps in diagnosing issues if they occur during reading.

Eliminate Redundant Close Call: The explicit reader.close() call is removed since try-with-resources handles the closing automatically.

Main Method:
An example usage with StringReader is provided in the main method for testing purposes. This part is optional and intended to demonstrate how the StreamPrinter.print method can be used.

This implementation improves robustness by ensuring proper resource management and better handling of potential I/O exceptions.


-Question 31;

Modify the body of some methods (this can include the body of the constructor) to protect Person instances against alteration: Once a Person is created, it should not be possible to modify it.


import java.util.Date;
class Person {
private String name; 
private Date birthDate;
//Creates a Person with the given name and birth date.
public Person(String name, Date birthDate) {
this.name =name;
this.birthDate =birthDate;
}
public String getsame (){return name;
}
public Date getBirthDate() {return birthDate;
}}

answer :

import java.util.Date;

class Person {
    private final String name;
    private final Date birthDate;

    // Creates a Person with the given name and birth date.
    public Person(String name, Date birthDate) {
        this.name = name;
        // Creating a defensive copy of the mutable date object
        this.birthDate = new Date(birthDate.getTime());
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Date getBirthDate() {
        // Returning a defensive copy of the mutable date object
        return new Date(birthDate.getTime());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        Date date = new Date();
        Person person = new Person("John Doe", date);
        
        System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName());
        System.out.println("Birth Date: " + person.getBirthDate());

        // Trying to modify the date should not affect the Person's birthDate
        date.setTime(date.getTime() - 1000000000L); // Modify the original date
        System.out.println("Modified Original Date: " + date);
        System.out.println("Person's Birth Date after modification: " + person.getBirthDate());
    }
}


question 32;

One of your colleagues developed the program displayed in the answer editor. The Program class is used for obtaining information on a piece of text, such as the number of words it contains.
The current code works correctly but you are asked to improve it so that the program is able to accept new commands.
	•	﻿﻿Create an abstract class Command, containing an abstract method exec. This method is supposed to return a String, and has one parameter named text of type String:
	•	﻿﻿Create a class WordCount Command, inherited from Command. Override the method exec. It must do the same actions as what currently does the class Program, when it receives the command "CountWords".
	•	﻿﻿Add a method registerCommand to the class Program. This method must have two parameters:
	•	﻿﻿commandName, of type String,
.
command, an instance of a class inherited from Command.
	•	﻿﻿Change the body of the method String exec(String commandName, String text), It must execute the method exec of the corresponding registered Command. The correspondance is based on commandName. If the Program class doesn't have the required command, it must throw an IlLegalArgumentException, as it currently does.
	•	﻿﻿The Program class must not have any dependency to WordCounter, because this dependancy will be moved to the class WordCount Command|:
Be careful to use the exact specified names for the classes and method to add, otherwise the automatic validation will fail. These names have been put as commentaries in the starter code, so that you can copy-paste them.
Make sure the Program class is able to associate any command to any command name (not just "CountWords"). The automatic validation will check that too.

```java

import java.util.*;

// add a class "Command" and a class "WordCountCommand here

class Program (
// add a method "registerCommand" here.
// keep the method "exec*, but change its body.

String exec(String commandName, String text) {
if (!”CountWords". equals (commandName) ) {
throw new IllegalArgumentException(commandName) ;
}

return WordCounter.count(text);
}}


```
answer:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Abstract class Command
abstract class Command {
    abstract String exec(String text);
}

// WordCountCommand class
class WordCountCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    String exec(String text) {
        return String.valueOf(countWords(text));
    }

    private int countWords(String text) {
        if (text == null || text.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        String[] words = text.split("\\s+");
        return words.length;
    }
}

class Program {
    private Map<String, Command> commands = new HashMap<>();

    // Method to register commands
    public void registerCommand(String commandName, Command command) {
        commands.put(commandName, command);
    }

    // Modified exec method
    public String exec(String commandName, String text) {
        Command command = commands.get(commandName);
        if (command == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(commandName);
        }
        return command.exec(text);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Program program = new Program();
        program.registerCommand("CountWords", new WordCountCommand());

        String text = "Hello world! This is a test.";
        System.out.println(program.exec("CountWords", text)); // Should print the number of words
    }
}

```


Question 33;
```java
BigInteger b = new BigInteger(“1”);
b.add (new BigInteger (“1”));
```

What is the value of b?

The value of b remains unchanged as 1.

This is because the add method in the BigInteger class does not modify the original BigInteger instance. Instead, it returns a new BigInteger instance that contains the result of the addition. In your code, you are not assigning the result of the addition to b.

Here's the explanation with code comments:

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BigInteger b = new BigInteger("1");
        b.add(new BigInteger("1")); // This creates a new BigInteger with value 2, but doesn't change 'b'
        
        System.out.println(b); // This will print "1"
    }
}


```
Question 34;

TreeSet<A> set = new TreeSet<A>();
set.add(new A());


Type the name of the interface that should be implemented by the class A.


answer :

The TreeSet class in Java requires that its elements implement the Comparable interface, or alternatively, a Comparator can be provided to the TreeSet to define the order of its elements. This is because TreeSet sorts its elements in a natural order or according to the specified comparator.

So, to ensure that instances of class A can be added to a TreeSet, class A should implement the Comparable interface.

Here’s an example of how class A should implement the Comparable interface:

```java
public class A implements Comparable<A> {
    // Add any fields and methods here

    @Override
    public int compareTo(A other) {
        // Implement the comparison logic
        // For example, if class A has an int field 'value', you might compare like this:
        // return Integer.compare(this.value, other.value);
        
        // Assuming comparison logic is based on some field or fields
        return 0; // Replace with actual comparison logic
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<A> set = new TreeSet<>();
        set.add(new A());
    }
}

```


example with a field :
```java
public class A implements Comparable<A> {
    private int value;

    public A(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(A other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.value, other.value);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<A> set = new TreeSet<>();
        set.add(new A(1));
        set.add(new A(2));
        set.add(new A(3));
    }
}

```

Question 35;
Type the name of a class  belonging to the package java.lang which allows
to concatenate efficiently strings of characters.


answer :

The class in the java.lang package that allows efficient concatenation of strings is StringBuilder.

StringBuilder Class
StringBuilder is designed for use in a single-threaded context, where it provides an efficient way to concatenate strings without the overhead of creating new string instances as with the String class.

Here is an example demonstrating the use of StringBuilder for concatenating strings:

```java

public class StringBuilderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        sb.append("Hello");
        sb.append(" ");
        sb.append("World");
        sb.append("!");

        String result = sb.toString();

        System.out.println(result);  // Output: Hello World!
    }
}


```


Question 36;
J2SE API provides a class which helps at transforming a date from a string to an object of type Date. Do you know the name of this class?

answer:
Yes, the class provided by the J2SE (Java SE) API for transforming a date from a string to an object of type Date is called SimpleDateFormat.

Here's an example of how you can use SimpleDateFormat to parse a date string into a Date object:

```java
import java.text.ParseException;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

public class DateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dateString = "2024-06-22";
        SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");

        try {
            Date date = formatter.parse(dateString);
            System.out.println("Parsed Date: " + date);
        } catch (ParseException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```
Question 37:
The JDBC API provides an interface that should be used to prevent against SQL injection. Type the name of this interface.

The interface provided by the JDBC API that should be used to prevent against SQL injection is PreparedStatement.

Using PreparedStatement helps in preventing SQL injection because it allows you to set parameters in a SQL query, rather than embedding the parameters directly into the query string. This ensures that the parameters are properly escaped and treated as data rather than executable code.


Question 38;
File f = new File(“/tmp/myfile”);
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStrean(f);
ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
oos.writeobject (myobject);

Type the name of the interface myobject should implement.

answer :

The interface that myobject should implement is Serializable.

In Java, to serialize an object (convert it to a byte stream for storage or transmission), the object's class must implement the Serializable interface. This interface is a marker interface, which means it does not contain any methods but serves to indicate that the implementing class is capable of being serialized.

Here's how you can define a class to implement Serializable:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class MyObject implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    private String data;
    
    public MyObject(String data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
    
    // Getter and setter methods
    public String getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public void setData(String data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
}

```
Question 39;
J2SE provides a class to access thread-scope variables. If you know it, type its name in the text field.

The class provided by J2SE (Java SE) to access thread-scope variables is ThreadLocal.

ThreadLocal provides thread-local variables. Each thread accessing such a variable has its own, independently initialized copy of the variable. ThreadLocal instances are typically private static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread.

class ScrollBarEnhancement extends WindowEnhancement (
public ScrollBarEnhancement(Window window) {
super (window);
public void draw() ‹ drawScrollBars():
window .draw();
private void drawScrollBars() 1
// draw scroll bars
class WindowTest (
public static void main(Stringll args) (
Window w - new ScrollBarEnhancenent (new SinpleWindow());
w.drawt):

```java
interface Window {
    void draw();
}

class SimpleWindow implements Window {
    public void draw() {
        // draw simple window
        System.out.println("Drawing a simple window");
    }
}

abstract class WindowEnhancement implements Window {
    protected Window window;

    public WindowEnhancement(Window window) {
        this.window = window;
    }

    public void draw() {
        window.draw();
    }
}

class ScrollBarEnhancement extends WindowEnhancement {
    public ScrollBarEnhancement(Window window) {
        super(window);
    }

    public void draw() {
        drawScrollBars();
        super.draw();
    }

    private void drawScrollBars() {
        // draw scroll bars
        System.out.println("Drawing scroll bars");
    }
}

class WindowTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Window w = new ScrollBarEnhancement(new SimpleWindow());
        w.draw();
    }
}

```

the design pattern is :


The design pattern illustrated by the code is the Decorator pattern.
